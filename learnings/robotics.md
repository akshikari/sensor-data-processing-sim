## Kinematics

- [Quadruped Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_2swSMecB4)
- Sensors
  - [IMUs](https://github.com/martinling/imusim), associated [white paper](https://proceedings.scipy.org/articles/Majora-ebaa42b7-00b.pdf)
    - Wish I found this much earlier on. Was a great reference to read after the fact though.
  - [Accelerometers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuekQ-m9xpw)

## Physics

- [Rotation Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WRmjKDit2I)
- [Roll, Pitch, Yaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5CpG1eq5uQ)
- [Coordinate vs. Proper Acceleration](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/66839/relativistic-factor-between-coordinate-acceleration-and-proper-acceleration)
- [Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)](https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/phy2048tjb/chapter/15-1-simple-harmonic-motion/)
- [Quaternions](https://www.3dgep.com/understanding-quaternions/). Don't use this but just putting it here for later reading
