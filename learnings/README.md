# Notes

Notes on various things learned throughout the development of this project
For the sake of time, anything marked with a `$$` I decided to have an LLM,
mostly Gemini, teach me with (sometimes many) examples.

This project started out as primarily a means to brush up on some data
engineering skills, learn new ones, and update myself on the latest
best tooling out there for data engineering. But it quickly evolved into
a foray into the Robotics domain and some basic concepts & principles
as simulating accelerometer data from a walking quadruped proved to be
beyond my current knowledge. I chose to use an
LLM to explain things to me with the explicit instruction not to provide
code unless I asked and to instead explain the concepts using just layman's
terms and formulas as needed. This method of using LLMs
was mainly used for learning Kinematics, re-learning some basic Linear Algebra
and Calculus, and how to perform all these calculations using NumPy and SciPy.
In most cases the LLM was not sufficient and I supplemented with other online
resources as well.

Also just as a bonus I used this project to learn development using tmux and neovim.
